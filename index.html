		    	<p>You must have seen the impressive 72-10 record at the closing of the 1995-96 NBA season, right? Well, do you remember that it was said that no team would ever beat the Chicago Bulls’ dominant record? Yeah. 20 years later, Steve Kerr (who played for Chicago) guided his Golden State Warriors team to a 73-9 record. So, take that.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords01_.jpg" alt="Illustration of golden state basketball 73-9 season" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: NBATV.com</p></div>
<p>The Warriors proved that even the most unbreakable of records can still be overthrown. Yet, that said, these next sports records are really, really, really unlikely to be broken. But hey, you never know!</p>
<h2>Ty Cobb’s Batting Average</h2>
<p>The game of baseball has gone through some changes throughout the last century, so you can argue that it isn’t fair to compare past players to today’s modern version of the game. But look, getting a hit is pretty much still the same, is it not?</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords02_.jpg" alt="Ty Cobb on the baseball field. " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: si.com</p></div>
<p>Ty Cobb, the legendary Detroit Tiger outfielder, played in the Big Leagues for more than 20 years, gaining a career batting average of .366 while hitting over .400 in three separate seasons. The closest any player got to him was Miguel Cabrera with a career .316 batting average. To paint the picture, he would have needed to make more than 400 more hits to match Cobb’s record. And to give some perspective, only the best in the league can manage 200 hits in one season.</p>
<h2>Jack Nicklaus’ PGA Majors</h2>
<p>Not too long ago, a young Tiger Woods took the PGA Tour by storm and racked up 14 Major wins in 11 seasons. Impressive. But even the biggest fans of Jack Nicklaus knew that it was only a matter of time before he would break that record. His 18 Major victories are yet to beat.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords03_.jpg" alt="Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: sportsbreak.com</p></div>
<p>By 2009, Woods’ personal life and the professional game fell apart. After surgeries and attempted comebacks, Woods is a 40-something shell of his former self, another guy on tour. Anyway, Nicklaus’ record is safe from Woods’. Rory McIlroy and Ernie Els each have four wins, which is the closest among active golfers. And four isn’t close at all, fellas.</p>
<h2>Bobby Orr’s Record in 1970-71</h2>
<p>In the 1970-71 NHL season, Bobby Orr produced one of the most amazing feats in the history of the sport. Orr came racked up a season of 37 goals and 102 assists. As if that wasn’t insane enough, he posted a plus-minus number of +124.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords04_.jpg" alt="Bobby Orr on the Ice court. " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: dailydsports.com</p></div>
<p>So you know, Wayne Gretzky’s best plus-minus season was +100, and only three players in NHL history have made +100 or more (Larry Robinson is the third). Today, a high plus-minus number is anything above +40. So, yeah. That’s insane.</p>

<p>In October 2019, Biles beat Vitaly Scherbo&#8217;s record of 23 world medals that he won in the 1990s. Biles won her 24th and 25th world medals, both gold.</p>
<h2>Gordie Howe’s Six Decades of Playing</h2>
<p>Mr. Hockey himself, Gordie Howe, broke into professional hockey with the Omaha Knights in 1945. He spent the 50s and 60s playing with the Detroit Red Wings, earning four Stanley Cups. While playing in three different decades is impressive enough, Gordie really brought it home in the years that came after.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords05_.jpg" alt="Gordie Howe is skating in his fifth decade" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: si.com</p></div>
<p>Howe left Detroit in 1971 to join the Houston Aeros of the upstart WHA. A short period with the New England Whalers meant that Howe had thus played at least one pro hockey game in five different decades. Then, in 1997, Howe signed a one-day contract with the Detroit Vipers (of the now-obsolete IHL). And so, at 69-years-old, Howe skated his way to becoming the only player to compete in six different decades. Nice.</p>
<h2>Michael Phelps’ Olympics Medals</h2>
<p>Michael Phelps, the king of swimming, garnered national attention at five different Olympic Games — from Sydney 2000 to Rio de Janeiro 2016. Over 16 years, Phelps remained unstoppable. He set 39 different world record times (29 individual races and 10 more in relay races with teammates).</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords06_.jpg" alt="Men's 4 x 100m Medley Relay Final medals celebration at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio De Janeiro. Michael Phelps and his last Olympic race." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Petr Toman / Shutterstock.com</p></div>
<p>But beyond all that insanity, what’s most impressive is Phelps’ medal counts. He has a grand total of 23 gold medals. 28 in total if you include the two bronze medals in 2004, two silver medals in 2012, and a single silver in 2016). The former swimming champ was Mark Spitz, who won 11 Olympic medals between 1968 and 1972.</p>
<h2>Richard “The King” Petty’s NASCAR Wins</h2>
<p>Look, they don’t call him “The King” for nothing. NASCAR pioneer Richard Petty is basically royalty when it comes to stock car racing. He’s won more than everyone else, by a long shot. He raced regularly from 1958 to 1992, earning a grand total of 200 wins (119 in the Strictly Stock/Grand National Series; 81 in the Winston Cup; and 60 in the Modern Era).</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords07_.jpg" alt="STP celebrates Richard Petty's 25th Anniversary before the start of the Coke Zero 400 race in on Jul 3, 2010, in Daytona Beach, FL." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Action Sports Photography / Shutterstock.com</p></div>
<p>Maybe even more impressive are his 7 different victories in the Daytona 500. Second place after Petty is David Pearson, with 105 total wins (about half of Petty’s). The closest current racer is Jimmie Johnson with 83, and he’s already in his 40s. Kyle Busch, still in his early 30s, is the next closest active racer. And he only has 43 wins. So it looks like the King will remain on top. For now…</p>
<h2>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s NBA Points</h2>
<p>First of all, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played for 20 seasons in the NBA, which is a lot longer than the average professional basketball career. He might have needed all those years to break one of the game’s most coveted records: all-time points scored. He averaged 24.6 points per game for his whole career.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords08_.jpg" alt="Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the basketball court. " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: basketballforever.com</p></div>
<p>He recorded an incredible 38,387 points in those two decades on the hardwood. Karl Malone came close, with just under 37,000 points. And then Kobe Bryant is in third place, with 33,643.</p>
<p>The closest current NBA player to break the record? LeBron James, who has 32,593.</p>
<p>* Statistics accurate as of April 10, 2019</p>

<h2>Glenn Hall’s Streak of Consecutive Appearances</h2>
<p>Glenn Hall’s streak of 502 consecutive appearances is so unbreakable is because he played goalie. Not only did he have to endure being pelted with a frozen rubber puck for 502 straight games, but he also did it during an era before goalie masks were even a thing.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords09_.jpg" alt="Glenn Hall on the Hockey Ice" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: nhl.com</p></div>
<p>Hall started playing in the NHL in 1952 and then played consistently from 1955 to the end of his career in 1971. Hall only started wearing a mask near the end of NHL career, which means the man was insanely tough or plain lucky. Or maybe both.</p>
<h2>Eric Gagne’s Save Streak</h2>
<p>Dodgers closer Eric Gagne recovered from Tommy John surgery early in his career to eventually make it as a dependable reliever in 2002. He earned 52 saves in his first season as a closer, which is really something for a beginner.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords10_.jpg" alt="Eric Gagne in Dodgers uniform." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: am570lasports.iheart.com</p></div>
<p>In 2003, Gagne saved 55 more games for the Dodgers, and with that, he became the first pitcher to record 50+ saves in more than a season and the fastest reliever to 100 saves. In 2004, he managed to get to 84 consecutive saves (in three seasons) before finally breaking the streak.</p>
<h2>Johnny Vander Meer’s Consecutive No-Hitters</h2>
<p>Former Cincinnati Reds pitcher Johnny Vander Meer didn’t hold a Hall of Fame career; his 3.44 ERA and a 119-121 win-loss record was spoiled by control issues and inconsistent performances. But, for one week in 1938, Vander Meer was just about perfect.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords11_.jpg" alt="Johnny Vander Meer, shown in this undated photo, the Cincinnati Reds' pitcher who threw the only back-to-back no-hitters in major league history. " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: AP</p></div>
<p>On June 11, he no-hit the Boston Bees, and just four days later, he no-hit the Brooklyn Dodgers. Most pitchers go their entire careers without even one no-hit, so getting two in a row is unheard of. Vander Meer’s streak is one of the most impressive feats in baseball history.</p>
<h2>George Blanda’s Interceptions</h2>
<p>An NFL football season is now 16 games long, but that only started in 1978. Before that, a regular-season was only 14 games long. That makes George Blanda’s 42 interceptions in the 1962 season that much more impressive.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords12_.jpg" alt="George Blanda" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: YouTube.com</p></div>
<p>Vinny Testaverde came the closest to breaking this record, having thrown 35 picks in 1988 (but remember that he also had two extra games to do it). And since 1990, only Brett Favre (29 in 2005), Peyton Manning (28 in 1998), Drew Bledsoe (27 in 1994), and Eli Manning (27 in 2013) cracked the Top 20 all-time single-season interceptions.</p>
<h2>Nolan Ryan’s Strikeouts and No-Hitters</h2>
<p>Nolan Ryan played pro baseball for a noteworthy 27 seasons. That alone is remarkable, but he also made some of the most unbreakable pitchers records ever during his Hall of Fame career. The most obvious one? He recorded 5,714 strikeouts.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords13_.jpg" alt="Nolan Ryan celebrating on the field. " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: si.com</p></div>
<p>Even more unbreakable than Ryan’s strikeout record is his record of 7 no-hitters. The best modern pitchers have only been able to get to two (including Randy Johnson, Mark Buehrle, Roy Halladay, Justin Verlander, Homer Bailey, Tim Lincecum, Max Scherzer, and Jake Arrieta).</p>
<h2>John Stockton’s Assists and Steals</h2>
<p>John Stockton is one of the NBA’s best players in history to never win a championship. In 19 seasons with the Utah Jazz, he was the ideal point guard and was considered the best “true” point guard, with 15,806 career assists.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords14_.jpg" alt="John Stockton in Utah Jazz." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: Pinterest.com</p></div>
<p>When it comes to steals, Stockton is far ahead of everyone else with 3,265 under his belt. He has more than 700 extra steals than Michael Jordan. The closest active player is Paul, who has 1,983 steals to his name.</p>
<h2>Old Hoss Radbourn’s Wins in a Season</h2>
<p>Major League pitcher wins today mean something else, with advanced metrics like K/9, WHIP, and Quality Starts, to more accurately determine a pitcher’s true value. But win-loss records are still noteworthy, and winning 20 games in one season is still celebrated.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords15_.jpg" alt="Old Hoss Radbourn" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: nonohitters.com</p></div>
<p>No one will ever touch Old Hoss Radbourn’s record from 1884 of 59 wins, a season where he started 73 games! He posted an ERA of 1.18 and pitched 678.2 innings (by the way, anything over 200 IP is considered a heavy workload these days).</p>
<h2>Byron Nelson’s Consecutive PGA Tour Wins</h2>
<p>In today’s competitive golf world, winning two or three tournaments in a row is already a major feat. But no one beats Byron Nelson. He’s not as famous as Tiger Woods or Jack Nicklaus, but Nelson is one of the all-time greats, and 6th on the PGA Tour wins list with 52.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords16_.jpg" alt="Byron Nelson playing Golf." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: britannica.com</p></div>
<p>Nelson had an astonishing year in 1945 (a year before retiring), where he won a total of 18 tournaments — 11 of them were in a row. Now, that’s incredible, folks. Tiger Woods called Nelson’s brilliant year, “one of the greatest years in the history of sport.”</p>
<h2>Pete Rose’s Career Hits</h2>
<p>With 24 years under his belt, Pete Rose holds the crown for the most MLB records. One which is hard to see ever being topped is his number of career hits: a staggering 4,256. He leads the 3,000 hit club. Cobb follows close behind with 4,191, but the closest to him is Hank Aaron, with 3,771.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords17_.jpg" alt="Pete Rose " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: britannica.com</p></div>
<p>At the moment, Ichiro Suzuki and Adrian Beltre are the only active members of the 3,000 hit club. They have 3,080 and 3,048, respectively. It’s that the longevity and consistency of a Pete Rose is simply no longer found in baseball. It would require a batter to make 200 hits each season over 21 campaigns to come close to Rose’s amazing record.</p>
<h2>Jerry Rice’s Career Receptions</h2>
<p>There isn’t a receiver more prolific than Jerry Rice, the all-time leader in dozens of categories. One of his records unlikely to be eclipsed is his career receptions, standing at a jaw-popping 1,549. Throughout a 20-season career, Rice was an unstoppable force.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords18__1.jpg" alt="Jerry Rice on the Football field. " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: YouTube.com</p></div>
<p>Rice accumulated 1,549 total receptions, 22,895 total receiving yards, and 197 touchdown passes. Tony Gonzalez is second place, with 1,325. The closest active player is Larry Fitzgerald, with 1,234.</p>
<h2>Boston Celtics’ Consecutive NBA Titles</h2>
<p>Sure, the word “dynasty” gets thrown around a little too much in sports. But, the 1960s Boston Celtics, were the epitome of a dynasty and completely dominated the NBA. The legendary coach, Red Auerbach, led the team to eight consecutive NBA titles between 1959 and 1966.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords19_.jpg" alt="Boston Celtics flags, celebrating seventeen NBA Championships. A record eight in a row from 1959-1966. Three separate championship eras." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: nba.com</p></div>
<p>The Celtics also won in 1957, 1968, and 1969. Then, Bill Russell retired and brought the dynasty that had lasted over a decade to an end. The closest any team has come since is a “mere” three consecutive titles. The Bulls in the 90s, and the Lakers between 2000 and 2002.</p>
<h2>Joe DiMaggio’s Hit Streak</h2>
<p>Joe DiMaggio wasn’t the greatest player of all-time, but his record stands the test of time. Back in 1941, New York Yankees’ legend Joe DiMaggio made history when he got at least one base hit in 56 consecutive games.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords20_.jpg" alt="Ted Williams and Joe Dimaggio chat in the dugout before their game on Aug. 18, 1942, at Fenway Park in Boston." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: si.com</p></div>
<p>The period lasted from May 15 to July 17, in which DiMaggio hit .408. The record has hardly been touched, but Pete Rose came close with 44 consecutive games in 1978. 75 years on, this untouchable record may just last forever.</p>
<h2>Cal Ripken Jr.’s Consecutive Games Played</h2>
<p>Consecutive games played is a category that shouldn’t be overlooked. The MLB’s greatest ironman is Cal Ripken Jr., who played in an unfathomable 2,632 consecutive games, spread out over 16 years (from 1982 to 1998).</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords21_.jpg" alt="Cal Ripken Jr. 1997." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: britannica.com</p></div>
<p>Playing for the Orioles in that period, Ripken amassed an amount that a player earns over his entire career, let alone consecutively. These days, MLB players sit out for all kinds of reasons. But Ripken suited up every game regardless of any injuries.</p>
<h2>Brett Favre’s Consecutive Games Played</h2>
<p>Another ironman was Brett Favre, who played in 297 consecutive NFL games (321 if you include playoffs). This fantastic accomplishment occurred between 1992 and 2010, which is particularly impressive, considering the physicality of the sport and the injuries that occur.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords22_.jpg" alt="Brett Favre in Packers uniform. " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: YouTube.com</p></div>
<p>Believe it or not, Favre even played the night after his father passed away. He famously finished with 399 passing yards. Peyton Manning comes in second with 208 regular season starts.</p>
<h2>Wayne Gretzky’s Career Points</h2>
<p>Wayne Gretzky, “The Great One,” earned himself a glittering career, one of the best in all sports. He held 61 records upon retiring in 1999. What will never be toppled is his career points: a breathtaking 2,857.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords23_.jpg" alt="Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky waves to the crowd during practice for the NHL’s Heritage Classic Alumni game in Winnipeg on Oct. 21." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: latimes.com</p></div>
<p>In second place is Jaromir Jagr, with 1,921; nearly 1,000 shy of Gretzky’s intimidating total. But Jagr is now in his late 40s and playing in Europe. So, it’s safe to say that the record is more than safe.</p>
<h2>Wilt Chamberlain’s Points in a Single Game</h2>
<p>Wilt Chamberlain holds a few unbreakable NBA records. The most notable record, though, is scoring 100 points in a single game (this was before the three-point line was introduced). The closest anyone came to reaching this mark is Kobe Bryant, with an 81-point performance in 2006.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords24_.jpg" alt="Wilt Chamberlain holds a paper with the number 100 written on it. " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: inquirer.com</p></div>
<p>Let’s be clear that Kobe Bryant is, without a doubt, one of the great scorers of all-time. But even his effort was well short of Chamberlain’s. Only a handful of players drop 50 points every season.</p>
<h2>Cy Young’s Complete Games and Wins</h2>
<p>This remarkable record will never be toppled, and it’s mostly because of the changes in the sport. Cy Young pitched in an era when pitchers pitched every other day and threw entire games regularly. This resulted in an incredible record where he completed 749 games and won 511.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords25_.jpg" alt="Cy Young pitching in 1908." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: bostonmagazine.com</p></div>
<p>Over a 22-season career (from 1890 to 1911), Young set tons of records, which include most career innings pitched, most career games started, and the most losses in MLB history. Pitchers now throw every 5th day.</p>
<h2>Tris Speaker&#8217;s Career Doubles</h2>
<p>Look, there’s way more effort and strategy that goes into hitting a double than hitting a home run. Tris Speaker refined the double, earning 792. Whether he hit a line drive to the gap or stretched a single into a two-bagger, he was good at getting to second base.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords26_.jpg" alt="Tris Speaker Betting" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: baseballhall.org</p></div>
<p>Pete Rose retired with the second-most career doubles, at 746. Ivan Rodriguez is the current doubles leader with 566. Recently retired Manny Ramirez was close behind, with 547.</p>
<h2>Tiger Woods’ 1997 Masters</h2>
<p>Tiger Woods burst onto the golf scene in 1997 when he won the Masters by a record-making 12 strokes. It was the beginning of an era that saw Tiger destroy his competition with ease, all while becoming the world&#8217;s most famous athlete.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords27_.jpg" alt="tiger woods at World golf championship, Doral, Miami, Feb 2007, Florida" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Isogood_patrick / Shutterstock.com</p></div>
<p>The Masters began in 1934, and before Tiger’s 12 strokes, the previous record was held by Jack Nicklaus, who won with nine strokes in 1965.</p>
<h2>Ron Hunt’s Hits by Pitches</h2>
<p>&#8220;Some people give their bodies to science, I give mine to baseball,&#8221; Ron Hunt famously stated. Hunt&#8217;s 50 HBP in 1971 put to shame the previous post-1900 record of 31 HBP in one season, which was held by Steve Evans.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords28_.jpg" alt="The Giants' Ron Hunt admires his Most Hit by Pitcher award on July 19, 1970. " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: stltoday.com</p></div>
<p>Hunt claims that he was never intentionally hit; rather, he would lean into a pitch and happen to get hit. The modern-day HBP career record is held by former Astros second baseman Craig Biggio. Biggio took one for the team with getting hit 285 times throughout his career.</p>
<h2>Michael Jordan Points in Consecutive Games</h2>
<p>Hands down, Michael Jordan, is the greatest player in NBA history. But you&#8217;d be surprised by how many &#8220;simple&#8221; records he doesn’t have. So, to include him on this list, this is one unbreakable record: he scored 10 or More Points in 866 consecutive games.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords29_.jpg" alt="Michael Jordan, 1988." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: britannica.com</p></div>
<p>MJ played for the Chicago Bulls in 1,109 games. He scored double-digits points every single game except for one where he scored only eight points – back in 1986. Jordan retired as the career leader in average points per game, with an average of 31 points per game.</p>
<h2>Night Train Lane’s Intercepts and Passes During the 1952 Season</h2>
<p>In his rookie season in 1952, Night Train Lane managed to intercept 14 passes to break the prior NFL record of 13 in one season. It wouldn’t happen today since coaches don’t throw in a player&#8217;s direction if he’s picking off passes left and right.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords30_.jpg" alt="Night Train Lane" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: YouTube.com</p></div>
<p>In 1980, Lester Hayes fell just one interception shy of tying Lane&#8217;s record, but other than that, nobody has threatened his record.</p>
<h2>Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Consecutive Games Lost in 1976-77</h2>
<p>The Bucs lost an NFL record of 26 games in a row in the 1976-77 season, which unfortunately happened to be their first 26 games as a franchise. Ouch. They did, however, win the final two games in their second season.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords31_.jpg" alt="Forty years ago, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers entered the NFL as an expansion team. They lost their first 26 games." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: wbur.org</p></div>
<p>Both of the opposing coaches got fired immediately after losing to the Bucs. The 2008-09 Detroit Lions almost made a run at the record, but fell short, losing “only” 19 in a row.</p>
<h2>Walter Johnson’s Career Shutouts</h2>
<p>Johnson is known as the only real power-pitcher of his era, with his 3,500 strikeouts to go with his 110 shutouts. He was the only member of the 3,000 strikeout club for more than 50 years until Bob Gibson joined in 1974.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords32_.jpg" alt="Walter Johnson" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: twitter.com</p></div>
<p>Pitchers Roger Clemens (46 shutouts), Randy Johnson (37 shutouts), and Greg Maddux (35 shutouts) are the only recent pitchers in the all-time top 100 list.</p>
<h2>Lance Armstrong’s Consecutive Wins 7 in Tour De France Races</h2>
<p>Let’s face it; Lance Armstrong made cycling cool. After he survived testicular cancer and removing tumors from his brain and lungs, Armstrong gave the world hope by winning 7 Tour de France races in a row.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords33_.jpg" alt="February 14, 2009: Lance Armstrong's debut return to cycling at the Amgen Tour of California time trials in Sacramento on Feb. 14, 2009." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Karin Hildebrand Lau / Shutterstock.com</p></div>
<p>There isn’t much else to say about this record other than how incredible it is. Just imagine it, and you’ll be amazed. He finally retired in 2011 after a much-debated controversy about doping.</p>
<h2>Bill Russell’s Wins NBA Championships</h2>
<p>Aside from those shorts they had to wear, it was all groovy for Bill Russell and the Boston Celtics in the late &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s. Russell played in the NBA for 13 seasons, and in 11 of those seasons, Russell managed to deliver championships.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords34_.jpg" alt="Bill Russell in Celtics uniform." width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: NBA.com</p></div>
<p>In that period, Russell won 5 MVP awards and was selected 12 times to the All-Star team. Russell and Wilt Chamberlain are the only two NBA players in history to grab 50+ rebounds in a game.</p>
<h2>Barry Bonds’ Home Runs</h2>
<p>To be honest, this record depends on how you look at it. As it turns out, Bonds was juicing. But he still hit those home runs. If we go back to before Bonds hit 73 home runs, before Mark McGwire hit 70, and before Sammy Sosa hit 66, 64 and 63; Roger Maris holds the single-season record at 61.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords35_.jpg" alt="Barry Bonds" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: usatoday.com</p></div>
<p>Regardless, Bonds’ record is one of sports&#8217; greatest and is worth mentioning on this list. Now in the post-steroid era of baseball, it&#8217;s an inevitable conclusion that no one will ever beat his 73 home runs.</p>
<h2>Emmitt Smith’s Rushing Yards</h2>
<p>Emmitt Smith broke Walter Payton&#8217;s record of 16,726 rushing yards by rushing 18,355 yards in his career. It’s safe to say that his record will never be broken because of the shelf life of running backs in today&#8217;s world of NFL.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords36_.jpg" alt="Emmitt Smith" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: gazettereview.com</p></div>
<p>LaDainian Tomlinson made a run at it, but now he&#8217;s part of this two-back system. So, there’s no way he can garner the 5,000 more yards needed to surpass Smith as the all-time rushing leader.</p>
<h2>Rickey &#8220;The Man of Steal&#8221; Henderson’s Bases</h2>
<p>&#8220;Lou Brock was the symbol of great base stealing. But today, I&#8217;m the greatest of all time,&#8221; Rickey Henderson said. He passed Lou Brock in 1991 to break the record with his 939th stolen bag.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords37_.jpg" alt="Rickey Henderson stealing a base" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: YouTube.com</p></div>
<p>Along with his 1,406 steals, Rickey Henderson owns the post-1900 era record with 130 stolen bags in a season. Amazingly, Henderson played for 13 different teams during his career.</p>
<h2>Johnny Unitas’ Touchdown Passes</h2>
<p>Johnny Unitas is one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, having accomplished touchdown passes in 47 consecutive games. It was during the 1956-60 era of &#8220;The Greatest Game Ever Played.&#8221;</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords38_.jpg" alt="Johnny Unitas" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: si.com</p></div>
<p>To break the record, a player today would need to throw a touchdown pass every game for three straight seasons. Brett Favre holds the second-longest streak with 36 consecutive games.</p>
<h2>Hack Wilson&#8217;s RBI During the 1930 Season</h2>
<p>The three things Hack Wilson was known for: drinking, fighting, and bringing in runs. His RBI record is still undefeated 80 years later. Up until the 1930s, it was common to see players driving in 170+ RBI in one season.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords39_.jpg" alt="Hack Wilson" width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: Amazon.com</p></div>
<p>Juan Gonzalez came in hot, heading into the All-Star break in 1998, but only finished with 157 RBI. Sammy Sosa batted 160 RBI in 2001, and Manny Ramirez came in with 165 runs in the 1999 season.</p>
<h2>Babe Ruth Ends Career with a .690 Slugging Percentage</h2>
<p>Babe Ruth is arguably the best player in MLB history. Even the players in the steroid-era didn’t come close to matching Ruth. His .690 career slugging percentage sits above Ted Williams’ .634.</p>
<div style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-3516" src="images/sportrecords40_.jpg" alt="Babe Ruth holding two baseball bats. " width="700" height="394"><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: 500ish.com</p></div>
<p>Even Barry Bonds, the career home run leader, only slugged .607. And then there’s Albert Pujols, the active leader, slugging a .622 to date.</p>
